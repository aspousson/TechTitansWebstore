			<h3>How we started</h3>
			<p>
				Welcome to the TechTitans Webstore!
			</p>
			
			<p>
				At the TechTitans Webstore, we're more than just an online retailer. Our journey began 
				in February 2012, when a group of friends kept running into the same issues. Our group was having trouble finding retro video games and comics.
				After a lot of searching, we finally found the game we were looking after posting to a forum. We bought the game, but when it arrived, we quickly realized it was a fake copy and was unplayable.
				That's when our team came up with the idea for our store.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				At TechTitans, we act as a middle man for sellers and buyers. Sellers send us their products, we authenticate and grade each product based on their condition, then post them to our store. 
				Once the product sells, we payout to the sellers, charging a small convenience fee to keep the store running. Over the years, we expanded to selling old consoles, trading cards, and comics.
				With thousands of 5 star reviews, you can be confident that you will be satisfied with your order
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Thank you for choosing TechTitans Webstore.
